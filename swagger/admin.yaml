        Log keys specify functional areas. Enabling logging for a log key provides additional diagnostic information for that area.
        
        Following are descriptions of the log keys that you can specify as a comma-separated list in the Log property. In some cases, a log key has two forms, one with a plus sign (+) suffix and one without, for example CRUD+ and CRUD. The log key with the plus sign logs more verbosely. For example for CRUD+, the log contains all of the messages for CRUD and additional ones for CRUD+.
