    <title>Migrating to using a distributed channel index</title>
    <description>Migrating an existing Sync Gateway deployment to using a distributed channel index</description>
    <introduction>
        <note>These instructions are for migrating an <emphasis>existing</emphasis> Sync Gateway deployment to use a distributed channel index. For instructions about creating a new Sync Gateway deployment that will use distributed channel indexing, see <ref href="deploying-channel-indexing.xml">Migration</ref>.</note>
        <paragraph></paragraph>
        <note type="caution">Mixed channel-indexing approaches are not possible. All Sync Gateway instances in a Couchbase Mobile deployment must use either channel caches or a distributed channel indexing. For a Sync Gateway cluster using channel caches, migration to using a distributed channel indexing must happen at the same time for all databases. <strong>After you migrate a deployment, you cannot migrate back.</strong> Migration must be done in a specific manner that requires simultaneous downtime of all Sync Gateway instances.</note>
