            <description>Introduction to channel indexing</description>
            <introduction>
                <paragraph>To efficiently fulfill read requests for documents, Sync Gateway performs channel indexing, identifying the document revisions that are assigned to each channel.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Sync Gateway 1.2 supports two approaches to channel indexing: using local channel caches and using a distributed channel index. Details about these approaches are below.</paragraph>
                <note type="caution">Mixed channel-indexing approaches are not possible. All Sync Gateway instances in a Couchbase Mobile deployment must be migrated to using the distributed channel-indexing service at the same time, for all databases. <strong>After you migrate a deployment, you cannot migrate back.</strong> Migration must be done in a specific manner that requires simultaneous downtime of all Sync Gateway instances.</note>

                        <paragraph>In Sync Gateway, channels play a central role in controlling read access to document revisions:</paragraph>
                        <unordered-list>
                            <list-item>Every document is associated with a set of channels. From the document's perspectives, the channels can be thought of as tags that identify the type, purpose, accessibility, and so forth, of the document revision. The app-defined sync function is responsible for assigning every document revision a set of channels as the document revision is saved to the database.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Every user and role has a set of channels that they're allowed to read. A user can only read documents that are in at least one of the user's channels (or the channels of roles that user has.) Access to channels by users and roles can be assigned directly through the admin API, or via the sync function when a document is updated.</list-item>

                        <paragraph>Beginning with Couchbase Mobile 1.2, all Sync Gateway instances in a Couchbase Mobile deployment can take one of two approaches to channel indexing (for all databases in the deployment):</paragraph>
                        <unordered-list>
                            <list-item><strong>Local channel caches</strong> (Sole approach in Sync Gateway 1.1): Each Sync Gateway instance writes a local, in-memory cache of the channel assignments of documents that have been modified recently. Channel caches do not contain complete channel indexes. When necessary, Sync Gateway instances can obtain channel-assignment information that is not in the local cache. Each Sync Gateway instance writes channel-assignment information to its local cache for all document modifications.</list-item>
                            <list-item><strong>Distributed channel index</strong> (New in Sync Gateway 1.2): All Sync Gateway instances read from the same channel index, which is stored in a Couchbase Server bucket. Sync Gateway instances that are identified as channel-index writers write to the channel index. The channel index is a complete index of the channel assignments of all document revisions.</list-item>

                    <body>
                        <paragraph>When using a distributed channel index, the DCP mutation feed is sharded and the shards are distributed across Sync Gateway instances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>This drawing illustrates use of local channel caches. Numbers identify key points that are explained below the drawing.</paragraph>
                        <note>The DCP mutation feed to a specific Sync Gateway instance is a single feed. Arrows in this drawing and the next drawing indicate logical mappings of shards to Sync Gateway instances, not the feeds.</note>
                        <image href="images/shards.svg" alt="Shards"/>
                        <paragraph>In the drawing:</paragraph>
                        <ordered-list>
                            <list-item>The app data bucket in the Couchbase cluster consists of vBuckets that are distributed across the Couchbase Server nodes that are running the data service (four nodes are shown here). For simplicity's sake, only vBuckets 0-15 are shown. The "M" indicates that these vBuckets are masters. Replicas are not shown in this drawing. Sync Gateway instances make and then use a consistent and unchanging assignment of vBuckets to shards. In this drawing, vBuckets 0 and 1 are in one shard (indicated by the color purple), 2 and 3 in the next (aqua), and so forth.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Sync Gateway instances that are channel-index writers distribute shards of the DCP mutation feed among themselves. For example, channel-index writer 1 monitors the shard of the DCP mutation feed that encompasses vBuckets 0, 1, 4, and 5; while channel-index writer 2 monitors the shard of the DCP mutation feed that encompasses vBuckets 8, 9, 12, and 13.</list-item>
                        </ordered-list>
                        <paragraph>If a Sync Gateway instance goes down, then the shards of the DCP mutation feed that it was handling are redistributed to running Sync Gateway instances. This drawing illustrates redistribution of shards. Numbers identify key points that are explained below the drawing.</paragraph>
                        <image href="images/shards-redistributed.svg" alt="Redistribution of shards"/>
                        <paragraph>In the drawing:</paragraph>
                        <ordered-list>
                            <list-item>As in the prior drawing, the app data bucket in the Couchbase cluster consists of vBuckets that are distributed across the Couchbase Server nodes that are running the data service and Sync Gateway instances make and then use a consistent and unchanging assignment of vBuckets to shards.</list-item>
                            <list-item>What has changed is that Sync Gateway instance 1, a channel-index writer, has gone down.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Sync Gateway instances that are channel-index wrtiers discover the absence of channel-index writer 1, and they redistribute shards of the DCP mutation feed among themselves, so that all shards are assigned to channel-index writers. In this case, the shard of the DCP mutation feed that encompasses vBuckets 0 and 1 has been given to channel-index writer 3, and the shard of the DCP mutation feed that encompasses vBuckets 4 and 5 has been given to channel-index writer 2. If channel-index writer 1 comes back online, the Sync Gateway instances will discover that too, and will again redistribute shards.</list-item>
                        </ordered-list>
