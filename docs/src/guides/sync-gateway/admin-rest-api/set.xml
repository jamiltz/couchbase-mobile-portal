    <description>Admin REST API for administrative purposes</description>
    <introduction>
       <paragraph>Two REST APIs are available for Sync Gateway. We document the Public REST API in <ref href="../rest-api/set.xml">Public REST API</ref>. To interact and manage the Couchbase Server Sync Gateway, you can use the Admin APIs that are illustrated in
      this reference article.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The Admin REST API is a superset of the Public REST API with the following major extensions:</paragraph>
        <unordered-list>
         <list-item>The capability to view, create, and modify users and roles.</list-item>
         <list-item>The capability to perform management tasks such as creating and deleting databases.</list-item>
         <list-item>The capability to perform administrative tasks without authentication. The Admin REST API operates in superuser mode—you can view and modify anything without needing a password or session cookie.</list-item>
        </unordered-list>
        <paragraph>By default, the Admin REST API runs on port 4985 (unless you change the <code>adminInterface</code> configuration parameter). <strong>Do not expose this port</strong>—It belongs behind your firewall. Anyone who can reach this port has free access to and control over your databases and user accounts.</paragraph>
       <note type="tip">
          A quick way to tell whether you are communicating with the Admin REST API is by sending a <code>GET /</code> request and checking whether the resulting object contains an <code>"ADMIN": true</code> property. HTTP requests logged to the console show the user name of the requester after the URL. If the request is made on the admin port, this is <code>"(ADMIN)"</code> instead.
