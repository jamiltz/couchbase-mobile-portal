            <description>How to take databases offline and bring them online</description>
            <introduction>
                <paragraph>While running, a Sync Gateway instance usually maintains connections with all of the databases that are defined in the configuration file that was used when the Sync Gateway instance was started. These databases are referred to as being <emphasis>online</emphasis>. When a database is online, Sync gateway serves both Public REST API and Admin REST API requests for the database.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>In Sync Gateway 1.1, there was no ability to take a database offline at Sync Gateway, that is, to manage the connection with the database by some means other than redirecting traffic at a reverse proxy or stopping the Sync Gateway instance. If a Sync Gateway instance serves multiple databases, then stopping a Sync Gateway instance to take one database offline would also take the other databases offline, even if that is not desirable.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Sync Gateway 1.2 introduces functionality that permits a specific database to be taken offline and brought back online, without requiring that the Sync Gateway instance be stopped and without affecting other databases that are served by the instance. An offline database is not accessible through Sync Gateway's Public REST API. However, some commands can be given to Sync Gateway through the Admin REST API. The database in Couchbase Server is not down.</paragraph>
                <note>This online/offline status for a database is with respect to a specific Sync Gateway instance. The status does not apply to other Sync Gateway instances, unless coordinated operations there have brought the databases on those instances into the same state.</note>

                        <paragraph>The database offline/online functionality that is being introduced in Sync Gateway 1.2 permits you to take <emphasis>individual</emphasis> databases offline and to bring them online again. The motivations for this functionality include:</paragraph>

                            <list-item>Allowing operations that impact service delivery for a specific database (such as resynchronization) to occur without removing Sync Gateway instances from service, and thereby impacting the service delivery for other databases.</list-item>

                        <paragraph>By default when Sync Gateway starts, it brings all databases that are defined in the configuration file online. To keep a database offline when Sync Gateway starts, you can add the configuration property <code>offline</code> to the database configuration properties for the database, with the value <code>true</code>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Later, to bring the database online, you can use the <code>POST _online</code> Admin REST API request.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Sync Gateway will take a database offline automatically if specific conditions occur. Specifically, if Sync Gateway detects that the DCP feed or TAP feed for a database has been lost, then Sync Gateway takes the database offline automatically, so that the problem can be investigated. When the cause is known and has been corrected, you can use an Admin REST API request to bring the database back onine.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>You can use the <code>PUT /{db}</code> Admin REST API command to create a database. By default, the database that is created is brought online immediately. To create the database and keep it offline, include the configuration property <code>offline</code> with the value <code>true </code>in the database configuration properties for the database that you are posting in the request body.</paragraph>

Also as before, all databases served by the instance can be taken fully offline by stopping a Sync Gateway instance.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>Sync Gateway 1.2 adds the ability to start a Sync Gateway instance with one or more databases “offline.” This offline is not fully offline, but rather it blocks all Public REST API traffic and permits only specific Admin API commands. As before, the Sync Gateway instance can be stopped, which takes all databases served by the instance fully offline.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>To the left of the gray dashed line, starting or stopping a Sync Gateway instance affects the connections to all of the databases that the instance serves. To the right of the gray dashed line, you perform operations on specific databases. For example, two databases could be online, while a third database could be taken offline, resynchronized, and then brought back online.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>Through the Admin API, Sync Gateway 1.2 adds the ability to take one or more databases (that is, the connections to the databases) offline, without stopping the Sync Gateway instance.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>Through the Admin API, you can bring offline databases back online, either immediately or with a specified delay.</list-item>
