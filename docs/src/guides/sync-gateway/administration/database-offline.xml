            <title>Taking databases offline and bringing them online</title>
            <description>How to take databases offline and bring them online</description>
            <introduction>
                <paragraph></paragraph>
                <paragraph>While running, a Sync Gateway instance usually maintains connections with all of the databases that are defined in the configuration file that was used when the Sync Gateway instance was started. These databases are referred to as being <emphasis>online</emphasis>. In Sync Gateway 1.1, databases to which a Sync Gateway instance is not connected are <emphasis>offline</emphasis>.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>This online/offline status for a database is with respect to a specific Sync Gateway instance. It is the status of the connection of that Sync Gateway instance to the database. The database status does not apply to other Sync Gateway instances, unless coordinated operations there have brought the database connection into the same state. Offline also does not mean that the database itself is down. A database that is offline with respect to Sync Gateway is available in Couchbase Server.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Prior to Sync Gateway 1.2, to take a database offline required stopping a Sync Gateway instance. If a Sync Gateway instance serves multiple databases, then those databases are also taken offline, even if that is not desirable.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Sync Gateway 1.2 introduces functionality that permits a specific database to be taken offline and brought back online, without requiring that the Sync Gateway instance be stopped and without affecting other databases that are served by the instance.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>In Sync Gateway 1.2, "offline" also has a different meaning. An offline database is not accessible through Sync Gateway's Public REST API. However, some commands can be given to Sync Gateway through the Admin API. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The database offline/online functionality that is being introduced in Sync Gateway 1.2 permits you to take <emphasis>individual</emphasis> databases offline and to bring them online again. The motivations for this functionality include:</paragraph>
                        <unordered-list>
                            <list-item>Reducing the number of administrative tasks that require Sync Gateway instances to be restarted.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Allowing operations that impact service delivery for a specific database (such as resynchronization) to occur without removing Sync Gateway instances from service, and thereby impacting the service delivery for other databases.</list-item>
                        </unordered-list>
                        <paragraph>Specific uses for the database offline/online functionality include:</paragraph>
                        <unordered-list>
                            <list-item>Taking a database offline, without affecting other databases.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Changing configuration properties for a database (while it is offline), without needing to restart Sync Gateway.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Resynchronizing a database while it is offline.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Detecting a lost DCP or TAP feed, and taking the database offline automatically.</list-item>
                            <list-item>Creating a database in an offline state, so that the start of service delivery for the database can be postponed or coordinated across Sync Gateway instances.</list-item>

                                    <list-item>The only way to take a database offline (to interrupt the connection between Sync Gateway and the database) is to stop Sync Gateway. This also affects all other databases that the Sync Gateway instance serves.</list-item>

                                <paragraph>This state diagram represents the states for Sync Gateway and for the connection between Sync Gateway and a Couchbase Server database, in Sync Gateway 1.2. Numbers identify key points that are explained below the state diagram.</paragraph>
                                <image href="images/state-diagram-offline-12.svg" width="80%" alt="State diagram version 1.2"/>
                                <paragraph>In the state diagram:</paragraph>
                                <ordered-list>
                                    <list-item>As in Sync gateway 1.1, all databases defined in the configuration file can be brought online (a connection is established with them) when a Sync Gateway instance is started. Also as before, all databases served by the instance can be taken fully offline by stopping a Sync Gateway instance.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>Sync Gateway 1.2 adds the ability to start a Sync Gateway instance with one or more databases “offline.” This offline is not fully offline, but rather it blocks all Public REST API traffic and permits only specific Admin API commands. As before, the Sync Gateway instance can be stopped, which takes all databases served by the instance fully offline.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>To the left of the gray dashed line, starting or stopping a Sync Gateway instance affects the connections to all of the databases that the instance serves. To the right of the gray dashed line, you perform operations on specific databases. For example, two databases could be online, while a third database could be taken offline, resynchronized, and then brought back online.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>Through the Admin API, Sync Gateway 1.2 adds the ability to take one or more databases (that is, the connections to the databases) offline, without stopping the Sync Gateway instance.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>Through the Admin API, you can bring offline databases back online, either immediately or with a specified delay.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>When a database is offline, you can resync the database. During the resynchronization, the database status is ReSyncing.</list-item>
                                    <list-item>When a database is offline, you can load configuration properties for the database, without stopping and re-starting the Sync Gateway instance. The new configuration properties are applied when the database is brought online.</list-item>
                                </ordered-list>
